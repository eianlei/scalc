<h1>SCALC Application</h1>
<p>
    <b>scalc</b> is a web tool for interactive calculations needed for planning technical scuba dives.
    It is currently work in progress and under active development.
    <P>There are many tools for different purposes and you can select then from the top menu.</P>
    The existing and planned calculation tools include:
    <ul>
    <li>MOD: MOD calculation: working </li> 
    <li>Blender: gas blending: working, needs improvement</li>
    <li>Planner: very primitive prototype, has many bugs and issues</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The calculation is done by javascript running on your browser and therefore this tool
    requires that your browser supports javascript and has it enabled.
