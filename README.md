# scalc
**scalc** is a Web tool for interactive calculations needed for planning technical scuba dives.

![mainwin-shorturl](https://github.com/eianlei/scalc/blob/master/scalc-planner.jpg?raw=true)


SCALC is currently work in progress and under active development.
The existing and planned calculation tools include:
- MOD calculation: working 
- gas blending: working, needs improvement
- dive planner: simple prototype, has many bugs and issues

# scalc at scalc.leiman.fi
There is a working sample of the tool running at: http://scalc.leiman.fi/

Note that the site leiman.fi does not have an SSL-certificate, so there is no HTTPS and therefore most browsers will give you warnings. 
But you can safely ignore the warnings. 

# Installation
This is a web application so it needs to be served by a web server to a web browser. You can either install it to a "real" web server (such Apache, nginx) or use some local development solution such as VS Code Live Server extension.
## web server
Just copy all the files in source folder to a web site server root. 
The web server will serve index.html, which will call out all the modules. 
Usually a web browser will cache the entire application as it so small. 
## VS code & Live Server
If you have Visual Studio Code installed, then it is really easy to run any web app using the Live Server extension.

In Visual Studio Code clone this repository.
Install "Live Server" extension. Now you can launch the app from editor to your browser using a local server with live reload.
## node.js

# Technology
**scalc** is made from plain vanilla HTML, CSS, Javascript and does not use any fancy JS frameworks (such as Angular, React, Vue, Svelte etc...).
The UI uses plain HTML5 elements and canvas.
Calculations are done by pure and simple Javascript functions running on your browser. There is no back-end, nothing is calculated at the server end.
## dependencies
jQuery

# Background
The Javascript used in calculations is refactored (manually transpiled) from following Python and C# projects that I have published previously:
- https://github.com/eianlei/pydplan 
- https://github.com/eianlei/FillCalcWin 
- 

The UI is a web (HTML5, CSS, JS) implementation of the respective GUIs done previously in Qt5 or WPF/.NET 4.8/XAML.

# Target users
The application is intended for certified technical divers and [Trimix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trimix_(breathing_gas)) gas blenders, who [blend gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_blending_for_scuba_diving) and make plans for [technical scuba diving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_diving).

It is assumed that anyone daring to use this application knows what they are doing.

# Disclaimers
Use this application at your own risk, the author provides no guarantees about the correctness of the application, and assumes no liability for the use of it for any purpose!

* In no event should you consider blending breathing gases without proper training!
* In no event should you consider scuba diving with mixed gases without proper training!
* Ignoring these warnings can cause your **death** or **serious and permanent injuries**!

# Development history & roadmap
- 2021-11-03 published to github a quickly hacked up demo, that needs lot of TLC
- 2021-11-08 added the dive planner prototype

todo short term:
- some cleanup, proper structuring and commentting to the sources
- make UI mobile friendly (CSS)
- do a proper favicon
- add user documentation
- to Blender: bring up all the same functionality that exists in [FillCalcWin](https://github.com/eianlei/FillCalcWin)
  - std gas dropdown
  - cost calculation
  - VanDerWaals
  - and something new: temperature compensations
- Planner implementation, 
  - BÃ¼hlmann: have manually transpiled Python code to Javascript from [pydplan](https://github.com/eianlei/pydplan), 
  but there are many issues to be fixed
  - improvements on graphical web UI

long term plans:
- re-target the HTML, CSS, JS implementation across all platforms
- desktop version will run on [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and include Windows installer
- Android and iOS mobile versions using [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/)
